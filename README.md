# VHDL

VHDL is a strongly typed, high-level hardware description language originally developed for the U.S. Department of Defense's Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) program. It enables the design and documentation of electronic systems at various levels of abstraction, from the system level down to the gate level.
